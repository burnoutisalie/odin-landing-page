# Project: Landing Page
##### *Foundations Course*
**Live Demo:** [Visit the website](https://burnoutisalie.github.io/odin-landing-page)

I was given a task to recreate a landing page using custom contents, but replicating styles and structure provided in ``img/full-desing.png`` and ``img/colors-fonts.png`` pictures.

I went with web development agency theme.

## Lessons Learned
- I have not missed any practice included in lessons, it really helped to build a muscle memory.
- This time, I did not spend a lot of time on the content. I just went with whatever seemed interesting and easy. Did not go over and beyond, which might have led to me speding huge amount of time on the thing that will disappear fast in a vast ocean known as the Internet.
